# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

Welcome to my Go-based repository for solving data structures and algorithms challenges! This project is a continuation of my journey in tackling diverse coding problems, originally started in Java.

In this repository, I'll be solving similar challenges to those in my [Java repository](https://github.com/brunoliveiradev/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms), but this time using Go. My goal is to explore and demonstrate how these problems can be approached with Go's unique features and strengths.

**Note:** While this repository is still in its early stages, you can find a more comprehensive and detailed collection of solutions in my [Java repository](https://github.com/brunoliveiradev/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms), which includes detailed documentation, explanations of various techniques, and problem-solving strategies.

## What's in this Repository?

This repository will eventually include:

- Solutions organized by approach and difficulty level.
- Go-specific insights and best practices for data structures and algorithms.
- Continuous updates as I solve new problems and explore different approaches.

## Reference to the Java Project

If you're interested in a more extensive and documented set of solutions, I encourage you to check out my Java-based repository:
[Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://github.com/brunoliveiradev/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms).
